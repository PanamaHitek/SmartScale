# SmartScale Python Scripts

To use the Python scripts in this directory, you must create a Python virtual environment (`venv`) in this path and install the required dependencies.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Create a virtual environment** (if not already present):

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install required dependencies**:

   ```
   pip install bleak
   ```

The scripts will only work if the virtual environment is set up and the dependencies are installed.
