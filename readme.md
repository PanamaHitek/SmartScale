# SmartScale v1.0.0

SmartScale is a software tool designed to read, plot, and export data to Excel from live readings of a BLE scale (RX402b20).  
It offers intelligent weight measurement and tracking solutions.

# Background

Recently, I needed an affordable, compact wireless scale for some lab experiments and discovered this model:

I purchased it for $35 on Amazon ([link](https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Bluetooth-Kitchen-Nutrient-Scale/dp/B009LCM8YY/ref=asc_df_B009LCM8YY)).

While the scale itself works well, the Android app frequently crashes after a few minutes, and the iPhone app is the only one that functions reliably. Unfortunately, there is no Windows support.

To address this, I decided to develop my own tool for use with this scale.

**The graphical user interface (GUI) is implemented in Java, while BLE communication and data retrieval are managed by Python scripts.**

## Development Process

The first step was connecting to the scale from Python. I developed the following script:

```python
import asyncio
import warnings
import json
from bleak import BleakScanner

# Suppress deprecation warnings from bleak
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=FutureWarning)

TARGET_NAME = "SC02"
SCAN_TIMEOUT = 5.0

async def scan_by_name():
    try:
        devices = await asyncio.wait_for(
            BleakScanner.discover(timeout=SCAN_TIMEOUT),
            timeout=SCAN_TIMEOUT + 1
        )
        matched = [
            {
                "address": d.address,
                "name": d.name or "Unknown",
                "rssi": d.details.rssi if hasattr(d, "details") and hasattr(d.details, "rssi") else d.rssi
            }
            for d in devices
            if TARGET_NAME is None or (d.name and d.name == TARGET_NAME)
        ]
        return {
            "found": bool(matched),
            "devices": matched
        }
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        return {
            "found": False,
            "devices": []
        }

def main():
    return asyncio.run(scan_by_name())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    result = main()
    print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))
```

I identified the target device name with help from the nRF Connect app on Android.  
This script checks if the scale is discoverable and retrieves its MAC address, which is required for further data communication.

After connecting to the device, I used a Python script to capture the data packets it periodically transmits. Each packet contains the measured weight (in grams) and a sequence of 17 bytes representing the raw BLE payload. Here is a normalized table of sample readings:

| Weight (g) | B00 | B01 | B02 | B03 | B04 | B05 | B06 | B07 | B08 | B09 | B10 | B11 | B12 | B13 | B14 | B15 | B16 |
|------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| 0.00       | 0f  | 05  | 02  | 00  | 00  | 00  | 5a  | 00  | 02  | 00  | 50  | fb  | 19  | 8a  | a0  | c2  | 1a  |
| 53.50      | 0f  | 05  | 02  | 00  | 14  | e6  | 5a  | 00  | 02  | 00  | 50  | fb  | 19  | 8a  | a0  | c2  | e8  |
| 53.48      | 0f  | 05  | 02  | 00  | 14  | e4  | 5a  | 00  | 02  | 00  | 50  | fb  | 19  | 8a  | a0  | c2  | ea  |
| 53.49      | 0f  | 05  | 02  | 00  | 14  | e5  | 5a  | 00  | 02  | 00  | 50  | fb  | 19  | 8a  | a0  | c2  | eb  |
| 58.92      | 0f  | 05  | 02  | 00  | 17  | 0a  | 5a  | 00  | 02  | 00  | 50  | fb  | 19  | 8a  | a0  | c2  | 07  |
| 59.04      | 0f  | 05  | 02  | 00  | 17  | 10  | 5a  | 00  | 02  | 00  | 50  | fb  | 19  | 8a  | a0  | c2  | 1d  |
| 73.50      | 0f  | 05  | 02  | 00  | 1c  | b6  | 5a  | 00  | 02  | 00  | 50  | fb  | 19  | 8a  | a0  | c2  | b0  |
| 76.50      | 0f  | 05  | 02  | 00  | 1d  | e2  | 5a  | 00  | 02  | 00  | 50  | fb  | 19  | 8a  | a0  | c2  | e5  |

This format made it easier to analyze the payload structure and map the relevant bytes to the actual weight readings.

Upon analyzing the data, I observed that only bytes **B04**, **B05**, and **B16** change with the measured weight.

By converting **B04** and **B05** from hexadecimal to decimal, I discovered the following relationship:  
If you multiply the decimal value of **B04** by 256 and add the decimal value of **B05**, you obtain the weight in grams multiplied by 100.

**Mathematical Model:**

Let $b_{04}$ and $b_{05}$ represent the decimal values of bytes B04 and B05, respectively (converted from hexadecimal).  
Let $W$ denote the weight in grams.

$$
W = \frac{b_{04} \times 256 + b_{05}}{100}
$$

This formula enables direct extraction of the weight in grams from the BLE payload using the decimal values of the relevant bytes.

To automate weight retrieval, I developed a script that connects to the scale and periodically prints the measured weight:

```python
# retrieve_data.py
import asyncio
import sys
import json
import time
from bleak import BleakScanner

def parse_smartchef_payload(data: bytes):
    try:
        if len(data) < 6:
            return {"error": "Payload too short"}

        b04 = data[4]
        b05 = data[5]

        weight_raw = b04 * 256 + b05
        weight = weight_raw / 100.0  # Convert to grams

        return {
            "timestamp": int(time.time()),
            "weight": round(weight, 2),
            "raw": data.hex()
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            "timestamp": int(time.time()),
            "error": f"Parse failed: {str(e)}"
        }

async def scan_for_smartchef(target_addr):
    def detection_callback(device, adv_data):
        if device.address.upper() == target_addr.upper():
            for _, payload in adv_data.manufacturer_data.items():
                parsed = parse_smartchef_payload(payload)
                print(json.dumps(parsed))

    scanner = BleakScanner(detection_callback)
    await scanner.start()
    try:
        while True:
            await asyncio.sleep(1)
    finally:
        await scanner.stop()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        sys.exit(1)

    target_mac = sys.argv[1]
    asyncio.run(scan_for_smartchef(target_mac))
```

This script will produce output similar to:

```
{"timestamp": 1749098287, "weight": 17.23, "raw": "0f05020006bb5a00020050fb198aa0c2a7"}
{"timestamp": 1749098288, "weight": 17.23, "raw": "0f05020006bb5a00020050fb198aa0c2a7"}
{"timestamp": 1749098288, "weight": 17.23, "raw": "0f05020006bb5a00020050fb198aa0c2a7"}
{"timestamp": 1749098291, "weight": 17.23, "raw": "0f05020006bb5a00020050fb198aa0c2a7"}
{"timestamp": 1749098291, "weight": 17.23, "raw": "0f05020006bb5a00020050fb198aa0c2a7"}
{"timestamp": 1749098293, "weight": 17.23, "raw": "0f05020006bb5a00020050fb198aa0c2a7"}
{"timestamp": 1749098293, "weight": 17.23, "raw": "0f05020006bb5a00020050fb198aa0c2a7"}
{"timestamp": 1749098294, "weight": 17.23, "raw": "0f05020006bb5a00020050fb198aa0c2a7"}
{"timestamp": 1749098294, "weight": 17.23, "raw": "0f05020006bb5a00020050fb198aa0c2a7"}
```

To execute the script, use the following command, replacing `<MAC_ADDRESS>` with your scale's MAC address:

```bash
python retrieve_data.py <MAC_ADDRESS>
```

For example:

```bash
python retrieve_data.py 50:FB:19:8A:A0:C2
```

## Usage

You can use the provided Python scripts directly, or take advantage of the Java-based graphical interface included in this project. The Java application communicates with the Python scripts to provide a user-friendly experience for reading, plotting, and exporting scale data.

The GUI is built using Swing, Apache POI, and JFreeChartâ€”classic libraries that remain effective for rapid development. While the interface is simple and was developed quickly (in just a few hours), it is functional and reliable for its intended purpose.
